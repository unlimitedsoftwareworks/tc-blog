# Type-C Closures

No one reads this blog anyway so I might as use it as backlog of ideas, for now :D

## Before we begin
Few important notes about Type-C:
- Register allocation: Type-C cores has 256 registers.
- Function Arguments, Locals and upvalues all live in registers
- Function argument registers are marked as busy d

## Current Behavior
Currently, functions are implemented as just numbers. Meaning when a variable is assigned a function, in the VM side it is just the address of the function in the code segment.
This works just fine, but as I am imlementing closures, this behavior is sadly about to change.

## New Approach

### Regular Function Call
For regular function calls, class/interface method calls, the behavior will always be the same. All functions will be referenced by their address in the code segment.
This is good not just for simplicity, but also for performance. We do not need to create any object that holds the reference to the function

### Anonymous Functions
```tc
fn f(x: u32) = x + 1
fn g(x: u32) = x + 2
fn h(x: u32) = x + 3

fn main() {
    let a = f(1)
    let b = [f, g, h]
    let c = b[0](1)
}
```

In this example, `f(1)` is a direct function call, the bytecode will be a direct call to the function address.

```
const_u32 tmp0, 1             ; the argument 1
fn_alloc                      ; init the .next func state
fn_set_reg_u8 0, tmp0         ; pass the first arg to R0
call_i @f                     ; call the function, @f is the address of f
fn_get_ret_reg_u8 tmp1, 255   ; get the return value
```

However, any function reference that is not used in the context of a function call, will be treated as a closure.
This means that the VM will allocate a closure object that holds the function reference and the captured variables.

so, `[f, g, h]` will be compiled to something like this:

```
closure_alloc tmp1, @f, 1 ; 1 is the number of occupied argument registers
closure_alloc tmp2, @g, 1
closure_alloc tmp3, @h, 1

a_alloc tmp4, 3, 8 ; array of 3 elements, each element is 8 bytes
...                ; push elements into the array
```

The result is essentially a function object within the bytecode, that contains the function reference and the captured variables.
In cases where no upvalues are captured, the env will simply be 0.

Let's take a look at an actual closure example:
```tc
type ClosureClass = class {
    let x: u32

    fn init(x: u32) {
        this.x = x
    }

    fn closure(y: y32) -> fn() -> u32 {
        return fn() -> u32 {
            return this.x + y
        }
    }
}
```

The class method `closure`, doe what you would expect, it returns a closure that captures the `this` object.
Now let's have a look at the generate IR for this function:

<img src="/images/2-closure-ir.png" alt="IR for ClosureClass.closure" />

`closure_push_env_<type>` captures the register given register into the closure object, and pushes it into the closure's captured variables,
which are esentially registers.

Here is how the Closure object looks like from VM's perspective:
```c
typedef struct TypeV_Closure {
    uintptr_t fnAddress;      ///< Function state
    TypeV_Register* upvalues; ///< Captured registers
    uint8_t envSize;          ///< Environment size
    uint8_t envCounter;       ///< Environment size
    uint8_t offset;           ///< Upvalues start registers, right after the args
}TypeV_Closure;
```

A closure needs a function to address, and the registered registers.
I have decided to use push instead of giving the captured upvalue index for simplicity and performance, especially
since the order is deterministic, at compile time.

### Calling a closure
First, a regular function state allocation must be done, this is to initialize the `.next` function state, which a separate state of registers and
execution environment for the VM.
Once that is allocated, arguments are also passed as usual. Notice how we are storing the `offset` field in the closure, this mark essentially
the number of arguments that are passed to function, closures will also be passed as registers, starting from `R_offset`
```c
static inline void closure_call(TypeV_Core* core) {
    uint8_t closureReg = core->codePtr[core->ip++];
    TypeV_Closure* cl = (TypeV_Closure*) core->regs[closureReg].ptr;
    // sets the enviroment of the core->funcState to the closure's enviroment
    const size_t adr = cl->fnAddress;

    // back up IP in funcState
    core->funcState->ip = core->ip;
    core->ip = adr;
    core->funcState = core->funcState->next;
    core->regs = core->funcState->regs;

    uint8_t offset = cl->offset;
    // copy the closure's environment to the function's environment
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < cl->envSize; i++) {
        core->funcState->regs[i+offset] = cl->upvalues[i];
    }
}
```

Finally, once the closure returns, we need to back up the registers to the closure object, this is done by a special instruction called
`closure_backup`, which is inserted by the compiler after a closure call.

```c
static inline void closure_backup(TypeV_Core* core) {
    uint8_t closureReg = core->codePtr[core->ip++];
    TypeV_Closure* cl = (TypeV_Closure*) core->regs[closureReg].ptr;
    uint8_t offset = cl->offset;

    for(uint8_t i = 0; i < cl->envSize; i++) {
        cl->upvalues[i] = core->funcState->next->regs[i+offset];
    }
}
```

This instruction is not modeled in the IR, as it is emitted by the bytecode generator, which generate concrete type-v bytecode.
After that, return values are also read from `.next` function state registers as usual.


### Impact of this this design choice:
- Upvalues passed by registers, means we do not need special instructions to read/write data from and to the closure object.
Everything is in registers minimizing the overhead.
- Too many Upvalues/Args/Local will add more stress on register allocator, and it might fail (extreme cases, which indicate bad code anyway)
- Even non-closure anonymous functions and lambda expressions are now created as closures.

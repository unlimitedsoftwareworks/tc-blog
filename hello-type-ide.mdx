# Happy new year!

## About Type-IDE
Type-C is going this new year with a new IDE specifically designed for it, which is called Type-IDE.

While I enjoy working a lot with vscode and cursor, I felt like Type-C needed a more specialized IDE,
specifically for views, symbol navigation, and debugging.

This IDE will have support for features like disassembly, debugging, auto-completion, and error feedback.

So what features can you expect from Type-IDE?
- Auto completion: Not as smart as VSCode, but it will get the job done.
- Error feedback: It will show you errors in your code.
- Symbol navigation: You can inspect symbols in your code
- Run! You can run your code directly from the IDE.
- Debugging: You can debug your code directly from the IDE.
- Github Copilot: Probably not going to be as good for Type-C, since it is a new language, but it will still help

## Tech Behind Type-IDE
The IDE is built with Electron, TypeScript, React and DaisyUI/TailwindCSS.
The Editor it self is monaco, same tech as vscode.

## Current Status
The IDE features a small websocket based server that communicates with the Type-C compiler.
This server is not compliant with Microsoft's LSP, it rather a custom websocket based server.

This Server keeps the state of the compiler in memory and will respond with the appropriate information when requested.

One major hurdle is that Type-C compiler is not incremental, it will crash. Making it unreliable for accurate error feedback
and auto completion.

This is something that still needs to be improved before the editor is made public.

## When to expect Type-IDE?
There are few issues and features that I want to implement before making the Editor public:
1. Full LSP compliance
2. Full GH Copilot Integration
3. Decreasing the amount of bugs in the Editor.

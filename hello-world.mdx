# Hello, world!

Finally Type-C Website is up and running! It took me a while but mainly due to "high standard" so to speak.
If Type-C is my creation, I wanted to shape and entire website to align very well with my vision and esthetics. I hope you like it!

This website is powered by `nextjs`, and the awesome `daisyui` and `tailwindcss`. 

Documentation and this blog are static `mdx` pages, each hosted on their own seprate repo for ease of maintenance and deployment. This was heavily inspired by `nextra`, 
which was the first template I used to start this project. Until I decided to go full custom.

The current state of Type-C at the time of writing is the following:

1. VM is being redesigned with some new changes I have implemented reguarding concurrency
2. Compiler frontend is almost complete, also needs changing for the code generator to adjust to the new VM design
3. VM Garbage Collector is being implemented and getting tested

It will take a while before Type-C is stable and ready for production, as both the compiler and the VM will need to be thouroughly tested,
this also takes into the account the lack JIT compiler, which is a must to have feature for Type-C

So when we are here, let's talk about the latest changes to the language design:

## Async Execution
It has been decided that `libuv` will be added to the VM as a FFI, to enable async execution of code. This will be a huge change to the language, 
as it will allow for more effiecient code execution per thread. 

## Threads
A new data type has been added `thread<T>`, which will allow for concurrent execution of code. Threads created this way maps to native OS threads.

## Comparaison with the previous design
In my original design, I wanted to implement Erlang like concurrency primitives (called Actors in Erlang, I called them Processes in Type-C). The feature didn't make it to the language level, but I was experimenting
on my VM, it worked very well. The assembly you are about to see is specific to Type-V and currently outdate (since process instructions have been removed)

```c
VERSION: 1

CONST:

GLOBAL:
    x: u64 = 0
CODE:
    p_queue_size r0
    debug_reg r0

    ; spawn
    p_alloc r1 proc1 ; allocate new process and 
                     ; store its address in r1
    mv_reg_i r12 10

    p_emit r1 r2 r3 ; emit to r2, msg r3,
                    ; promise stored in r3
    promise_await r3 ; await r3 promise, 
                     ;store result in r4
    promise_data r4 r3
    debug_reg r4
    p_send_sig r1 1
    halt


proc1:
    p_wait_queue ; process will always await for a message.
                 ; when no message is present, VM will be 
                 ; running other processes

    p_dequeue r14 r1         ; dequeue message from process queue
    mv_reg_i r15 1           ; store 1 in r15
    add_u32 r15 r15 r14      ; r15 := r14 + 1

    promise_resolve r1 r15   ; resolve promise with r15
    debug_reg r15            ; print r15        
    j proc1                  ; repeat
```

This approach worked very well in the VM, but there was one limitation, the VM will constantly need to check queue statuses and events, which when you have a lot of processes, will 
take a noticable time. This might endup slowing down the main process.

The goal of Type-C is to be a fast language, and this design didn't align with that goal. So I decided to go with a more traditional approach, which is threads. Each threads runs its own context, and some primitives has been added to the language to allow for communication between threads.

At the time of writing, the new design is being implemented language level, since we have new data types, compiler and code generator will need to be adjusted.

Wish me luck! ðŸ‘‹
